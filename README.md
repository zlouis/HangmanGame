# HangmanGame

8/12/16 Creating the hangman game will be a challenge. I outlined a psuedo code for it and then following the psuedo code to write JavaScript. I'm having difficulties in logging the letter of playerGuess to a specific line in the html and the playerGuess box. I will need to look up on how to command JavaScript to target specific lines in html and write out the letter. 

Another difficulty I have found is logging the number of guesses used. I will continue to google search these issues.
